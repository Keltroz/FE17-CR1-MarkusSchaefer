          <h2>Method</h2>
          <p>
            <b>STEP 1</b><br />
            First, make the pastry. Tip both flours and the sugar into a bowl
            with a large pinch of salt. Use your fingers to rub the butter into
            the flour mixture until it resembles crumble topping, then rub in
            the soft cheese until the pastry comes together. (If it’s still
            crumbly, add 1 tbsp iced water and it should come together.) Tip
            onto a surface and knead for 30 seconds, then cut off about a third
            of the pastry. Mould both pieces into flat rounds. Wrap and chill
            for at least 1 hr. <i>Will keep chilled for up to two days.</i>
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <b>STEP 2</b><br />
            Wash and drain the blackberries, being careful not to break them up,
            then tip into a bowl with the sugar. (If they are wild blackberries,
            they will need slightly more sugar.) Toss together and set aside
            while you roll out the pastry.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <b>STEP 3</b><br />
            Butter a 23cm pie dish and, on a lightly floured surface, roll the
            larger piece of pastry out into a round that fits the base of the
            dish with some overhanging. Push the pastry down in and around the
            dish to line it. Sprinkle the cornflour over the blackberries and
            gently mix together. Tip the blackberries and all their sugary
            juices into the pastry case and dot with the butter. Beat together
            the egg and milk to make a glaze, then brush the edge of the pie
            with some of it.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <br />
            <b>STEP 4</b>
            For an easy pie, simply roll out the rest of the pastry, drape it
            over the top, then trim and fork or crimp the edges together. For a
            lattice finish, roll the remaining pastry into a square, roughly 30
            x 30cm. Cut out 10 strips of roughly the same width. Lay five of the
            strips vertically over the pie, then weave with the remaining five
            horizontally, to create an even lattice over the fruit. Or, if you
            prefer, you can cut each strip into three thinner strips to weave a
            more delicate lattice. Pinch the edges, then trim the excess and
            crimp.

          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <br />
            <b>STEP 5</b>
            Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6 with a baking tray inside.
            Brush the top of the pie with more egg glaze and bake for 20 mins,
            then brush with the glaze again, scatter generously with extra sugar
            and bake for another 20-25 mins until the pastry is a deep golden
            colour and the juices are bubbling. Leave the pie to cool for at
            least 30 mins, then serve as is, or with ice cream.
